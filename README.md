</p>

#### Graph Editor Validations
We are just humans and we tend to do mistakes. This feature will try its best to track down all issues that might resolve in broken Dialogue Trees and inform you which node has what issues!
**Bonus:** Graph Validation reflects Themes! You can have Light or Dark one.
