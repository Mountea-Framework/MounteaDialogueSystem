## Features
### Graph Editor
This plugin comes with its own Graph Editor! This way you can easily connect nodes and visualise the Dialogue flow even for the most complex graphs you can imagine.

</p>

#### Graph Editor Validations
We are just humans and we tend to make mistakes. Graph Validator tries its best to track down all issues in the Editor before the project is packed, therefore saving a bunch of debugging hours for all parties included.
**Bonus:** Graph Validator reflects Graph Themes!

</p>

#### Graph Themes Settings
Dialogue Graph Editor settings contain a lot of settings that might help developers tweak the Dialogue Graph Editor to their liking.

#### Dialogue Previews
To save precious time, Dialogue Previews show the raw context of the Dialogue Data. What is this helpful for? Well, changing Dialogue Data automatically updates the Previews, showing what data will be played for this Node.

</p>

#### Dialogue Decorators
Introducing *Decorators*, a powerful yet versatile tool of Blueprint-based events that could be triggered per Dialogue Node! This provides a simple way to trigger cutscenes, switch cameras, end dialogues when being attacked or anything you like!

</p>

#### Dialogue Node Details
A new feature dropped in, and that is Node Style now supporting indications of how many Decorators each Node implements and whether it inherits Decorators from Graph or not. This will come handy for debugging dialogues, showing that some nodes might not implement required Decorators!

#### Editor Runtime Debug
A piece of helpful information is displayed in the Editor and Debug Builds alike.
