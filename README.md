## Features
### Graph Editor
This plugin comes with its own Graph Editor! This way you can easily connect nodes and visualise the Dialogue flow!

#### Graph Editor Validations
We are just humans and we tend to do mistakes. This feature will try its best to track down all issues that might resolve in broken Dialogue Trees and inform you which node has what issues!
